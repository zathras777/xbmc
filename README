Headless XBMC
=============

If you are looking for XBMC to play content, this isn't the repository you are
looking for.

This fork of the main repository is intended to allow me to store the changes
made to the main XBMC repository to allow for a headless server to be built
and run. 

To accomplish this, use --enable-headless for configure and run the resulting
xbmc.bin file as usual.
